# Structuring-Machine-Learning-Projects
To structure a machine learning project, start with data collection and preprocessing, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA). Define the model, train and evaluate it, then fine-tune as needed. Finally, deploy the model and monitor performance to ensure continuous improvement and adaptability to new data.
